### Describe the agile SDLC process with examples of at least 2 tools that can be used for each stage:

Software development life cycle (SDLC) is a phenomenon to design, develop and, test high-quality software. The primary aim of SDLC is to produce high-quality software that fulfills the customer requirement within times and cost estimates.

Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is the combination of both iterative and incremental process models. It focuses on process adaptability and customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of working software product. Agile SDLC breaks down the product into small incremental builds. These builds are provided into iterations.In the agile SDLC development process, the customer is able to see the result and understand whether he/she is satisfied with it or not. This is one of the advantages of the agile SDLC model. One of its disadvantages is the absence of defined requirements so, it is difficult to estimate the resources and development cost.

###### Agile SDLC Process Flow
1. Concept: Project are imagined and prioritized.
2. Inception: Team members are created, funding is put in place, and basic environments and requirements are discussed.
3. Iteration/Constriction: The software development team works to deliver working software. It is based on requirement and feedback.
4. Release: Perform quality assurance (QA) testing, provides internal and external training, documentation development,  and final version of iteration into the product.
5. Production: It is ongoing support of the software.

###### Tools

It includes several project management features that let you plan and streamline development processes within your organization.
2. Jira: JIRA software is by far the most popular agile tool for software teams. It was built for issue and bug tracking initially, but can be moulded to be used for software product development as well. Since JIRA software capabilities are nearly endless, it has become the default choice for most companies.
